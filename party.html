    <p style="background-color: white; font-size: 20px" class="w3-justify" style= "text-indent: 30px;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My wedding party consists of a great group of guys, who most of them I have know since grade school. Through out the years, we have created so many good memories together. We have motivated each other and helped each other through tough times over the years. Even though we are busy with our adult and family lives.. no matter how long we go without talking.. we can always just pick back up were we left off. I feel that the older we get the more we appreciate each other. This is a good group of guys, who I am proud and blessed to say are my good friends. I am excited to get these guys together and celebrate the big day.  </p>

          <!--<p>I have known Jared since third grade. We kicked it off in grade school with our love for dragon ball z. Jared and I would turn super Saiyan at recess and shoot kahmeha Maya’s at each other while the other kids would play sports. Jared has always had a big heart and is always the life of the party. He does not care what other people think and will have fun in every moment. He is one of the craziest people I have ever met,  but also one of the funnest to be around. Some of my best memories in life are spending hours laughing at absolutely nothing with this guy. I look up to Jared. He is a family man. He is an amazing father to his two beautiful daughters and a wonderful husband to his wife. At the wedding reception he will be performing “Hey Yeah” by OutKast on the dance floor. </p>-->

          <!--<p>I met Dennis in 5th grade. Growing up all of our friends would spend weeks at Dennis’s house playing video games. Dennis and I would pull all nighter’s during the summer  to beat co-op shooter games. He is one of the nicest people I have ever met and has a big heart. Dennis has great work ethic and is a great father to his son mason. It is always nice to laugh at all the memories we had growing up. Dennis has always been the one to say and do the weirdest and goofiest things of anyone I know to make us laugh. Dennis is a great guy and a great friend. You will see Dennis representing his work hard play hard ethic on the dance floor when the DJ plays wiz Khalifa. </p>-->

<!--<p>Jose runs and owns an accounting business in our hometown. This man has worked very hard to get where he is and is one of the smartest people I have ever met. I met jose in high school sophomore year. He was a quiet and good kid until our group of friends brought him to the dark side. Like I said he is honestly one of the smartest people I have ever met in my life, but together we have made some of the dumbest decisions throughout high school and college. Jose has been my right hand man out of high school. He has inspired me to have a good time and enjoy life, but work hard and hit goals. We have always motivated each other and have always been close friends. We share a lot in common especially after our step fathers, who raised us, both passed a few years ago. Jose is a businessman, but also a party man. You will most likely see him passed out on the dance floor.</p> -->       </div>

Over the years of being forced to hang out with each other through friends, we finally connected through lifting weights. Chuck helped me get my first job at 19 flipping burgers at the igloo diner. Chuck and I worked here for a few years as the main cooks. We would chug monsters at work and then hit the gym after. Chuck has been a great friend since and is always a real friend to converse with. He has always been true to himself and does not conform against his morals and beliefs. He has always inspired me to make smart decisions and not conform to others. Great guy and good role model. Single ladies watch out for chuck on the dance floor.</p>-->
